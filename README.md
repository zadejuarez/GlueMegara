[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/megara-visual-glue.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/megara-visual-glue)

This visualization tool for the MEGARA multi-spectrograph (https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/megara) has been developed with the Glue viewer (https://glueviz.org/), since this offers the possibility of defining custom code functions and including them in the file called `data_viewer.py`. The process has been accomplished at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in order to create an extensible tool in Python for the analysis of data obtained with MEGARA.
